## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
a = c(1,2,3,4,5)
```

```{r}
a = c(1,12,3,4,5)
```

```{r}
a = seq(1,10,2)
```

Matrixes
```{r}
a = matrix(1:9)
```

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
```

a*a is not how you do matrix multiplication

Proper matrix multiplication %*%
```{r}
a%*%a
```
invert matrixes

1/a - element wise multiplicaiton

there is a function in R that is called solve(a), in this case a is a singular matrix which you cannot invert it,

to make it non-singular we need to define a[], by changing six into seven (second row third columne)

the command is a[2,3] = 7

```{r}
a
```

```{r}
a[2,3] = 7
```

```{r}
a
```

the matrix a times its inverse is going to yield the identity matrix
```{r}
solve(a) %*% a
```
Say that we want to see how long a person lives

- air pollution
- smoke , if you smoke its true =1 , or not smoke false =0


```{r}
surv = data.frame(life=c(56, 76, 89), smoke = c(T, F, F), gender = c("Male", "Male", "Female"))
```

```{r}
attach(surv)
```

```{r}
smoke
```

What is a list, it's a list of things to do. Think about it as a to do list.

y is a vector
```{r}
b = list(x = 13, y =c(1,2,3), z="Paris", w=list(q = "hello", v=12))
```

what is a dollarsign? it accesses the sub-category

a$x

you will find x inside the list a

```{r}
b$w$q
```

rnorm(20 variables, 0 mean, 0.5 standard deviation)
lsfit computes the regression, gives you coefficient estimate etc,
model 1 is a list of things that we can see when we type in model1
```{r}
x = rnorm(20, 2, 3)
y=3+2*x+rnorm(20, 0, 0.5)
plot(x,y)
model1=lsfit(x,y)
```

```{r}
model1
```
- The error (or disturbance) of an observed value is the deviation of the observed value from the (unobservable) true value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean), 
- and the residual of an observed value is the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean). 

The distinction is most important in regression analysis, where the concepts are sometimes called the regression errors and regression residuals and where they lead to the concept of studentized residuals.

Why do we call it ab line? a+bx
first we need to plot the abline as it comes after plot
 
```{r}
model1=lsfit(x,y)
plot(x,y)
abline(model1$coef)
```

```{r}
model2=lsfit(x,y)
plot(x,y)
model2=lm(y-x)
```

#Make sure to label things for homework
```{r}
x = rnorm(20, 2, 3)
y = 3+2*x + rnorm(20, 0, .5)
plot(x,y)
model2 = lsfit(x,y)
abline(model2$coef)
plot(x,y, xlab="name of macron", ylab="name of y", main="french politics")
```
#Parameter
Use par() to see list different parameters for the function plot
```{r}
par()
```

Test a parameter

- CEX = Character expansion of three
```{r}
plot(x,y, xlab="name of macron", ylab="name of y", main="Parameter", cex=3)
```
lwd changes the dots
lty changes the distance between the dots
```{r}
plot(x,y)
model2 = lsfit(x,y)
par(cex=2, lwd=2, lty=3)
abline(model2$coefficients)
```
Cube root of x

Cube of -1 should be -1
NaN gives Not a Number, why does it produce this? 
Because R uses logarithms to carry out the computation. You cannot take cube root for a negative logarithm. Therefore we need to specify this more precisely.
```{r}
cube = function(x){x^(1/3)}
cube(8)
cube(-1)
```

== is equal
```{r}
cube = function(x){
  if(x>0) z=x^(1/3)
  if(x<0) z=-(-x)^(1/3)
  if(x==0)z=0
  z}
```

```{r}
cube(-1)
```
